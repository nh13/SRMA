=== Potential Features ===

Check the "TODO" comments in the source code.

In particular:
- update base qualities of color space reads after re-alignment.
- update mapping quality (?)
- output unmapped reads
- custom Exception handling
- add srma to the SAM header and SAM records when the alignment is modified.
- when an indel exists in the original alignment, allow it to be removed during
re-alignment.  This option/feature would be useful for 454 data or Single-Molecule Sequencing,
where indels are introduced pre-alignment.
