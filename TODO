=== Features ===

Check the "TODO" comments in the source code.

In particular:
- update base qualities of color space reads after re-alignment.
- fix mate information in SAM (MRNM, MPOS, ISIZE) or at least clear this information
- update mapping quality (?)
- allow for RANGES to be a string like "chr1:250-2500".
- fix artifacts imposed by coverage constraints around low-coverage regions and 
ends of chromosomes.  Maybe use "minor allele frequency", minimum total coverage before
the filter is applied, or Poisson likelihood (?). 
- output unmapped reads
