Array Jobs
----------
For SGE cluster, srma allows submission of array jobs, which 
allow a much more efficient use of cluster resources.  One
job is submitted per chromosome.

To use array jobs, change

    <queueType>SGE</queueType>

to

    <queueType arrayJob="true">SGE</queueType>

in your srma configuration file.

If one or more of the sub-jobs in an array job fails, resubmit 
them using qmod -cj <job_number> or qmod -cj <job_number> -t <task_id>
